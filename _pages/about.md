Hi, I am Yunlong Wang (王云龙), a sixth-year PhD candidate at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University** ([SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/)), **Antai College of Economics and Management** ([ACEM](https://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/en/)), advised by Dr. [Ying Rong](https://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/en/faculty/rongying.html) and Dr. [Taotao He](https://taotaoohe.github.io/). I am currently in a two-year visiting program (23 fall - 25 fall) at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder, [Leeds School of Business](https://www.colorado.edu/business/)), advised by Dr. [Rui Zhang](https://rui-zhang.org/). 

**I am on the 2025-2026 academic job market.**

My research lies at the intersection of **discrete choice modeling**, **optimization**, and **revenue management**, using mixed-integer programming approaches. I focus on the computational and algorithmic aspects of discrete choice models, as well as (social) network-based influence problems. I also have training in continuous optimization, particularly in advanced methods for algorithmic acceleration.

I have a couple of industry internship experiences at **Tencent** ([AI Lab](https://www.aiia-ai.org/col.jsp?id=184)) and **Huawei**, where I worked on accelerating machine learning algorithms and optimizing scheduling strategies for 5G base station operations, respectively.
